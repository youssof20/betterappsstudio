                <h2>Facilities Management Company — Multi-Location Operations</h2>
                <p class="case-study-text">A facilities management company with 18 field technicians across 12 locations was struggling with missed safety inspections and failed compliance audits. They were using paper checklists, WhatsApp groups, and a shared Excel spreadsheet that was constantly out of sync. Within two weeks of deploying our standard internal mobile system, the team eliminated paper tracking entirely. Within the first month, missed inspection reports dropped by 92%. The system prevented three potential compliance audit failures that would have resulted in $7,500 in fines and rework costs. Managers now have real-time visibility into all locations without daily check-in calls, saving approximately 6 hours per week in administrative time. The system paid for itself in the first incident avoided.</p>
